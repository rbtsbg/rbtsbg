# Hi there 😃

I am Robert, an ML Engineer (?) and PhD Candidate at the [Speech and Language Technologies Lab at DFKI Berlin](https://www.dfki.de/en/web/research/research-departments/speech-and-language-technology/). 

My interests include

  * (Neural) Explainability Methods and Explainable Models,
  * NLP and NLU, 
  * some Image Processing on the side, 
  * and Graph Algorithms because, you see, everything seems to be part of some graph.
