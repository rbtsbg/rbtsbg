# Hi there ðŸ˜ƒ

I am Robert, currently a data scientist and software engineer at [Tiplu](https://tiplu.de/).

I hold a PhD in computer science from TU Berlin. I conducted my PhD research at the [Speech and Language Technologies Lab](https://www.dfki.de/en/web/research/research-departments/speech-and-language-technology/) of the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI), where I worked at for almost seven years.   

My interests include

  * (neural) explainability,
  * NLP and NLU, 
  * (medical) image processing, 
  * and graph algorithms and networks because, you see, everything appears to be part of some graph.
